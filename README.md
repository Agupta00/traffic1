Cloud function that texts you if there is a faster route home than your default route. 


Generally when you commute to work you don't use google maps for directions (because you already know the way home).
What if there is an accident on your default route? In this case it would be nice a service texted you if there was a faster way home.

Set up your Home, Work, and normal commute time, and save time later !!
